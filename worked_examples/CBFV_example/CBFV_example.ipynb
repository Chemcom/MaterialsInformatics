These representations are less interpretable than a simple chemical formula, but are now mathematical vectors that represent the materials and do so with varying degrees of domain knowledge. In 2020 my group published a careful study that asked whether or not this domain knowledge was actually necessary or helpful in predicting materials properties. We essentially found that the domain knowledge does improve predictions, but as the data increases this advantage slowly disappears. \n",
